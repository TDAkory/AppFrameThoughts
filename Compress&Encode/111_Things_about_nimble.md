# Nimble

Meta is developing a new columnar file format called **Nimble**, which is designed to replace older standards like **ORC** and **Parquet** by prioritizing efficiency and extensibility. Originally optimized for **machine learning workloads**, it addresses performance bottlenecks by reducing **input/output (IO) overhead** and eliminating bloated metadata structures like stripe footers. A key innovation is its use of **nested encodings**, which allows for complex data structures to be stored in a way that is highly compact yet easily accessible without decompressing entire files. To ensure optimal performance across different use cases, Nimble features **pluggable selection policies** that use heuristics or historical data to choose the best encoding strategy for each column. While currently tailored for high-speed sequential reads in AI applications, the format is being expanded to support **general analytics** and will soon be released as an **open-source project**.
