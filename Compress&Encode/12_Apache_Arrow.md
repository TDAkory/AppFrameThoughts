# [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/index.html)

Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable big data systems to process and move data fast. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware.

This includes such topics as:

* Zero-copy shared memory and RPC-based data movement
* Reading and writing file formats (like CSV, Apache ORC, and Apache Parquet)
* In-memory analytics and query processing
