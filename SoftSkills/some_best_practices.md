# Some best practices

## Google

* One of the key elements of Google's software engineering culture is the use of defining software designs through design docs. 

* The design doc documents the high level implementation strategy and key design decisions with emphasis on the trade-offs that were considered during those decisions.
  * Early identification of design issues when making changes is still cheap.  
  * Achieving consensus around a design in the organization. 
  * Ensuring consideration of cross-cutting concerns. 
  * Scaling knowledge of senior engineers into the organization. 
  * Form the basis of an organizational memory around design decisions.
  * Acts as a summary artifact in the technical portfolio of the software designer(s).
