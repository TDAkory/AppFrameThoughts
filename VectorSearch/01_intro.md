# Basic understand of Vector Search

Vector search leverages machine learning (ML) to capture the meaning and context of[unstructured data](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/unstructured-data), including text and images, transforming it into a numeric representation. Frequently used for [semantic search](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search), vector search finds similar data using [approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms](https://www.elastic.co/blog/understanding-ann). Compared to traditional keyword search, vector search yields more relevant results and executes faster.

Vector search engines — known as vector databases, semantic, or cosine search — find the nearest neighbors to a given (vectorized) query.

Where traditional search relies on mentions of keywords, lexical similarity, and the frequency of word occurrences, vector search engines use distances in the embedding space to represent similarity. Finding related data becomes searching for nearest neighbors of your query.

Benefits of vector search:

- Semantic understanding
- Multimodal search capability
- Personalization and recommendations
- Critical in AI applications
